# perception_cuda_pcl

ros wrapper for [cuda_pcl](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/cuda-pcl), inspired by [perception_pcl](https://github.com/ros-perception/perception_pcl)

**note:** cuda_pcl is close source and only available in jetson devices.

cuda_pcl_conversion uses pcl's pointcloud definitions, so it depends on perception_pcl.
